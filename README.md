## Start Fresh Without the Chaos

This skill does the legwork of sorting what your app actually needs, so you can leave the clutter behind and start from a clean, modern boilerplate. It finds your public vs authenticated views, confirms what’s still relevant, and scaffolds a fresh platform area with core navigation — no forced full migration.

### Who it’s for
- Designers who want a clean, modern starting point
- Engineers who want clarity on routes, roles, and structure
- Product managers who need a real inventory of what’s still in use
- Business owners who want a new platform without legacy baggage

### What it does (in human terms)
- Separates public pages from authenticated ones
- Identifies role-based views and confirms what to keep
- Helps rename old, messy view names into clean ones
- Builds a new, isolated platform folder with core routes only
- Adds a simple entry link from the existing landing page

### What it does not do
- It does **not** migrate every legacy screen
- It does **not** change your auth logic
- It does **not** delete old code

### Quick start
1) **Discover** what views exist and who can access them
2) **Confirm** which views are still needed (and rename them cleanly)
3) **Name** your new platform and route segment
4) **Scaffold** a clean boilerplate under `app/<platform-segment>`
5) **Link** it from the existing landing header
